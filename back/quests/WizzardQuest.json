  "INTRO": "In the mystical realm of Elysium, a grand wizard's ancient tower looms in the distance. As you approach, the air crackles with magical energy, and you sense a powerful presence within. You enter the tower and find yourself in a vast chamber filled with arcane artifacts. A wise, old wizard materializes before you, eager to test your mettle with a challenge of magic.",
  "FIGHT": "You draw your wand and unleash a barrage of powerful spells, engaging the wizard in an epic duel. Your mastery of magic shines as you counter each of the wizard's attacks with precision and skill. Finally, you cast a devastating spell, overwhelming the wizard and emerging triumphant, a master of magic yourself.",
  "HIDE": "In a stroke of quick thinking, you dive behind a nearby bookshelf, using the ancient tomes as cover. The wizard's spells blast through the air, narrowly missing you. As the chaos subsides, you cautiously emerge from hiding, realizing that you have successfully evaded the wizard's assault.",
  "NEGOTIATE": "Recognizing the wisdom and knowledge of the old wizard, you engage in a conversation, appealing to their sense of reason. Through your eloquence and understanding of magical lore, you strike a bargain. The wizard agrees to share their vast knowledge and teach you a powerful spell in exchange for a rare magical artifact.",
  "ESCAPE": "With a surge of panic, you sprint towards the nearest exit, desperately trying to escape the wizard's clutches. Spells whiz past you as you navigate the maze-like corridors of the tower. Finally, you burst through the doors to freedom, leaving the wizard's realm behind.",
  "NOTHING": "Paralyzed by fear or uncertainty, you stand motionless, unable to take any action. The wizard seizes this opportunity, casting a spell of immobilization upon you. Helpless, you watch as the wizard continues their mysterious experiments, forever trapped in their magical realm."
