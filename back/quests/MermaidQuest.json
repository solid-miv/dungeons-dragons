  "INTRO": "Underneath the shimmering waves of the vast ocean, a mystical mermaid kingdom thrives. As you dive deeper into their realm, you encounter a curious mermaid, her iridescent tail glimmering with enchantment. She beckons you closer, eager to test your worthiness and unravel the secrets of the deep.",
  "FIGHT": "Drawing your trusty trident, you engage in a breathtaking underwater battle with the mermaid warrior. Your skillful maneuvers and swift strikes impress even the mermaid, who acknowledges your strength and bravery. With a final blow, you emerge as the victor, earning the respect of the mermaid kingdom.",
  "HIDE": "Spotting an intricate coral reef nearby, you quickly swim toward its intricate crevices and camouflage yourself amidst the vibrant marine life. The mermaid searches for you in vain, her voice fading into the distance. You emerge from your hiding spot, relieved and undetected by the mermaid.",
  "NEGOTIATE": "Approaching the mermaid with a genuine smile and respectful gestures, you attempt to communicate through gestures and shared understanding. Miraculously, you find a common language and establish a bond of friendship. The mermaid shares her wisdom and guides you towards a hidden treasure, grateful for your peaceful approach.",
  "ESCAPE": "Feeling overwhelmed by the majestic but unfamiliar underwater realm, you frantically swim away from the mermaid, your heart pounding with urgency. The mermaid pursues you for a while, but her grace and agility cannot match your determination. You eventually escape her grasp, returning to the surface unharmed.",
  "NOTHING": "In awe of the mermaid's beauty or uncertain of your course of action, you remain motionless in the water. The mermaid's enchanting melody lulls you into a trance, and you slowly lose consciousness. When you wake, you find yourself on the ocean floor, a guest in the mermaid's realm but forever separated from the world above."
