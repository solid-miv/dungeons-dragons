  "INTRO": "Beneath the vast expanse of a desolate desert, where the shifting sands hide ancient secrets, you come across a massive creature burrowing through the earth. It is a colossal worm, its serpentine form undulating with an eerie grace. As it emerges from the sand, the ground trembles beneath its weight, and the air becomes thick with the scent of dry earth and danger.",
  "FIGHT": "Bracing yourself for a harrowing confrontation, you gather your courage and ready your weapons to face the colossal worm. Its gaping maw snaps at the air, its armored segments glinting with menacing intent. Every strike tests your agility and resilience as you engage in a desperate struggle against the primal force of the desert. The ground quakes with each clash, until, with a final display of bravery, you deliver a decisive blow, vanquishing the worm and restoring peace to the arid landscape.",
  "HIDE": "Sensing the impending danger, you seek shelter among the labyrinth of rocky outcrops and deep crevices. The worm's relentless search sweeps over the barren terrain, its deep growls resonating through the silence. Concealed within the protective embrace of the desolate wasteland, you evade its detection as its interest wanes. Silently, you slip away, forever marked by the encounter with this formidable subterranean beast.",
  "NEGOTIATE": "Approaching the colossal worm with caution and respect, you strive to understand its motivations and the delicate balance it maintains within the desert ecosystem. Through careful observation and thoughtful gestures, you communicate your intentions, unveiling a symbiotic relationship that benefits both parties. Astonishingly, the worm recognizes your reverence for the land, offering its wisdom and guidance as you navigate the harsh desert terrain.",
  "ESCAPE": "Recognizing the overwhelming power of the worm, you swiftly retreat, maneuvering through the unforgiving landscape with nimble grace. The sound of its thunderous burrowing and the tremors of the earth follow you as you narrowly evade its pursuit. Through sheer determination and quick thinking, you manage to outpace the colossal worm, feeling the weight of the desert's gratitude on your shoulders.",
  "NOTHING": "Paralyzed by fear or indecision, you stand helplessly as the colossal worm's earth-shattering roars grow louder, its insatiable hunger consuming everything in its path. Its massive form engulfs you, dragging you deep into the desert's embrace, until all that remains is a cautionary tale whispered among nomads, warning of the treacherous nature of the wasteland."
