  "HIDE": "You quickly scan the surroundings and spot a cluster of thick bushes nearby. You silently slip into the foliage, holding your breath as the ogre searches for you. Time seems to stretch as the ogre's footsteps fade away. You emerge from hiding, relieved to have evaded the beast.",
  "NEGOTIATE": "You cautiously approach the ogre, extending a hand in a gesture of peace. To your surprise, the ogre ceases its aggressive stance and listens to your words. Through careful negotiation, you strike a deal. The ogre agrees to let you pass unharmed in exchange for a valuable item from your inventory.",
  "ESCAPE": "Fear takes hold of your heart, and your survival instincts kick in. With lightning speed, you sprint away from the ogre, zigzagging through the forest. The ogre gives chase, but your agility and cunning allow you to outmaneuver the lumbering beast, eventually losing it in the dense undergrowth.",
  "NOTHING": "Paralyzed by fear or indecision, you stand frozen in place, unable to take any action. The ogre takes advantage of your vulnerability, closing in with a thunderous roar. In a swift motion, it delivers a devastating blow, ending your adventure abruptly."
